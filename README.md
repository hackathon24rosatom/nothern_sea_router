# Nothern Sea Router (ROSATOM)

Nothern Sea Router is a Python library for dealing with ships caravans optimization.

## Rosatomflot digital platform

Rosatomflot is creating a unified platform for digital services along the Northern Sea Route. Safety and convenience are the main criteria that cargo carriers use when choosing transport routes. In order for them to make a choice in favor of the Northern Sea Route, a Unified Platform of Digital Services for the Northern Sea Route is being created, which has no analogues in the world. With its creation, users will receive an “ice navigator” that allows them to calculate travel time from point A to point B with an accuracy of several hours. With the help of a unique IT product, navigation along the Arctic highway will become as reliable and comfortable as along other popular transport routes.
 1. The main tasks that the service proposed for development by the competitors solves:
 1.1. Ensuring an increase in the productivity of the NSR by reducing the time for ice escort of transport ships (by optimizing convoys and reducing the time spent by cargo ships in the NSR conditions) and more rhythmic operation of convoys/cargo ships + nuclear icebreakers;
 1.2. Determination of the optimal point for the formation of caravans and automatic adaptive routing between points A and B
 2. Provide calculation:
 2.1. optimal routes for transport ships and caravans, taking into account the changing ice conditions presented in the problem conditions;
 2.2. configurations for the distribution of transport vessels among convoys for their subsequent passage by nuclear icebreakers along the NSR.

## Brief description of the task
Based on dynamic data on the ice situation on the NSR and a fixed graph of ship passages (typical ship routes) along the NSR, it is proposed to solve the problem of optimal movement of transport ships along the NSR, taking into account the needs for ice escort (nuclear icebreakers).

## Usage

```python
# example1

# example2
```

## Criteria for evaluation

 1. Visualization of results:
It is welcome to display the components of the task (objects - graph vertices, graph edges, cartographic background, starting and ending points of the route, animation of the movement of ships, dynamic display of the schedule of ships under individual icebreaker escort and in a convoy in the form of a Gantt chart)
 2. Achieving optimal targets:
Minimizing the time spent by transport ships in transit, minimizing downtime of transport ships and nuclear icebreakers.
 3. Ability to control input parameters, restrictions, target function
 4. Technical development of the solution:
The presence of a brief overview of the best practices for solving the problem of optimal planning, well-founded non-standard approaches, text and graphic descriptions of the solution in the form of flowcharts, and analysts on the technology stack for solving such problems are welcome.
